      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been passionate about computers and technology as far as I can remember. Everything started one christmas, when I was a little boy and my parents had given me a Nintendo 64.
Computer games and soccer sparked my interest in competition and continuous improvement - two attributes that still greatly benefit me in my daily professional life.
Providing value and making things as comfortable as possible for the people I work with and for are the goals I strive to achieve on a daily basis.</description>
